**poof sounds** is a Minecraft resource pack for Java Edition that replaces in-game sounds with audio clips of Poofesure! [Watch Poofesure play Minecraft with this sound pack here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0h4PMg7i348) ([and here!](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xruD5lhVHwQ))

**poof sounds** is compatible with Minecraft Java Edition version 1.20 and newer, although it will likely work with older versions as well (1.9 and newer).

## Bedrock Edition (Experimental)

**poof-sounds** is available for Minecraft Bedrock Edition on PC. Not all sounds will be mapped correctly, and there may be some issues with sound volume and pitch, as this pack is designed for Java Edition.
